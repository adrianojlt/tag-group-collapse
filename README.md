# tag-group-collapse

I use the Chrome tab group feature all the time, it allow me to better organize the open tabs.

When i need to go to a specific tab, i just search for it, and i am automatically taken to the 
tab i searched for, but if i jumped from a different group i will end up with two open group tabs.
It would be useful to have a shortcut to collapse all the groups that are not currently in focus.

That's what this extension is intent to do!

An Chrome extension to allow the collapse of all groups that are not currently in focus
