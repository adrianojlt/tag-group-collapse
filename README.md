# tag-group-collapse

I use the Chrome tab group feature all the time, it allows me to better organize my open tabs.

When i need to go to a specific tab, i just search for it, and i am automatically taken to the 
tab i searched for. However, if i jumped from a different group, i will end up with two open group tabs.

It would be useful to have a shortcut to collapse all the groups that are not currently in focus.

This extension adds the ability to use these shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Description |
| ---------| ------------|
| Alt+Shift+Up | Collapse all tab groups except the active one | 
| Alt+Shift+Down | Collapse all tab groups, or if all groups are collapsed, expand the one with the active tab |
