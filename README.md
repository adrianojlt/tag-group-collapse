# tag-group-collapse

I use the Chrome tab group feature all the time, it allow me to better organize the open tabs.
When i need to go to a specific tab, i just search for the tab and i will went automatically into the 
tab that i searched for, but if i jumped from a different group tab i will end up with two open group tabs.
It would be useful to have a shortcut to collapse all the groups that are not currently in focus.

That's what this extension is intent to do!
