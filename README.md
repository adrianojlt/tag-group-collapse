# tag-group-collapse

I use the Chrome Tab Groups feature all the time; it helps me keep my open tabs organized. When I need a specific tab, I simply search for it, and Chrome takes me there automatically.
However, if I jump to a tab in a different group, I often end up with multiple groups expanded at once, which clutters the bar. It would be useful to have a quick way to collapse all groups that are not currently in focus.

This extension solves that problem by adding the following shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Description |
| ---------| ------------|
| Alt+Shift+Up | Collapse all tab groups except the active one | 
| Alt+Shift+Down | Collapse all tab groups, or if all groups are collapsed, expand the group where the active tab is |
